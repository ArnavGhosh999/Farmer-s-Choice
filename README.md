<h1>Farmer's Choice</h1>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Nowadays we have seen that farming is a big job and an important job when it comes to Economic Growth of Country, city or district. 
In recent times we have seen that as farmers they have to struggle a lot to survive as farmers to feed their family as they struggle we meant by their profit from farming has seen a lot of downfall when a new farmer decides to farm some food materials he doesn't have that much knowledge about which soil to choose and which season to farm and all etc and our case study shows that in recent there has been lot of casualties about this and a farmer has to struggle always which they end-up have no money for their family and their survival chances decreases due to this . 

<h3>Our Solution</h3>
In seeing these circumstances me and my team have decided to create a hardware so that it can study the soil for the farmers to farm which help them in profit of money these soil mechanics will be studied and predict it's probability for farming in the soil will be beneficial or not by our Software these judgements would be given from past database and recommend it to the future farmer and it would also predict which food one should farm in which season months that would be beneficial to both of them. So if even after all of these the person face backdraws the govt would provide a financial aid to the farm so that he/she can regain its money and our team would provide full support for contacting the govt and suggest what major steps one should to prevent it fromÂ takingÂ loss.
